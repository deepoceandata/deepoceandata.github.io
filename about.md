Marine life is hidden from us by the depth of the World Ocean waters. It is quite difficult to discover somewhere in the ocean some single creature.
Nevertheless, life of big societies of marine dwellers is the subject of certain parameters that depends on ocean state and dynamics.

Today we can monitor ocean with the help of different oceanographic measurement systems and remote sensing space-based scanners.

Using the power of the most recent deep learning techologies and big amounts of oceanographic data, our **Deep Ocean Data** team discovers such kinds of complex dependencies and applies this knowledge to solving of most important problems in ocean life research and conservation.

We need extrememly in new collaborators in this pioneering research.

Here are the list of current and starting projects to participate:
* Detecting habitats of marine biosocieties using remote sensing data
* Research of activities of fishing vessels and their influence on marine ecosystem
* Estimation of marine populations sizes, their dynamics and dependence of different factors
